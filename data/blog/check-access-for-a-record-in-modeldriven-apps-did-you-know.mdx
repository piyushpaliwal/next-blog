As part of the ongoing platform improvements, recently there was a very useful tool which was released
**Access Checker**.

As system implementers, am sure we all have come across scenarios where we implemented a security model, however testing that model is challenging because you need access to a few user accounts where you'll change roles and test if the model works or not.

Yes, there are a community tools available, like this XRM Toolbox plugin. This works really well but its still a third party solution for something that should really be available out of the box with the platform.

Well, Microsoft has listened and they silently released a new tool right within the Model-driven apps interface.

## How do you get it?

All you need to do is navigate to the dynamics 365 record for which access needs to be checked for a particular user and you should see a new ribbon button called `Check Access`

By default, it shows your access information, but if you are an `System Administrator` then it will allow you to select another user in the system.

The best part is that access is checked against all of the possible scenarios

- Role based access
- Shared access
- Hierarchy access

This is a gamechanger and the implementer community will appreciate what Microsoft has delivered.

## Limitations?

As of now, with my limited research, I was not able to do the following

- Command Bar button visibility based on permissions. This still requires you to login with another user and validate, unless there is a way which I am completely missing out on üòä.
