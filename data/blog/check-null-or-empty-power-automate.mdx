Microsoft Power Automate is a great platform when it comes to designing your workflows or automations
with its easy to use drag-and-drop workflow builder and the hundreds of connectors that are available
for Power Users.

More often than not, we come in a situation where there is some data available, in a given format, say JSON, and we would like to check in the data if certain value exists or not and based on that, a logic needs to be written. I was surprised to find out that the **condition** step does not have a property to check for empty or null values.

So, now the obvious question;

## How do we check for null or empty?

Turns out, it is much more simple than I had thought, all you have know are a couple of mehtods which you can use in expressions.

### empty() Method

Empty method, as the name suggests, will return a `true` or `false` if the given data is blank.

```javascript
empty(<your-object>)
```

All you have to do is switch to **Expression** in the **Dynamic content** selection screen and start typing the formula and that's it! Take a look at one example below.
