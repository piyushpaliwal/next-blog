Earlier this week I was trying to setup Omnichannel for Customer Service trial on my tenant. Upon successful setup when I tried logging in using one of the agent logins, it went through, however there were some prominent errors.

- There was a problem with your single sign-on account. Please sign out of all Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps and sign in again.
- Presence loading failed

You can see both the issues in the screenshot below

It took me a while to figure it out as to what's going on. Wanted to share it with everyone with similar situation.

## Resolution

While setting up the trial, we almost never focus on the part which says **Help us protect your account**, instead just skip it.

In this case, turns out skipping this prompt is the reason why both the errors are shown up.

A simple fix to just go ahead and setup MFA even for the trial account will ensure the sign-in is successful and allow the presence to be loaded.
